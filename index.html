        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administration📚</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Yangjinning Yue. I am an international student.I am 19 years old. I have studied and lived in the United States for two years.
        I was a freshman and sophomore at Cascadia College in Seattle, and then I transferred to UCR to study Business Administration.My hometown is nanjing, jiangsu province.
        I have spent 17 years in China and started my study abroad in 2017.Actually, being an international student was not my original plan. This idea came into my mind when I was in junior high school.
        When I was in primary school, my mother liked to teach me all kinds of English words and watch English short video.I think the accumulation at that time made me have a strong interest in learning English in the future.
        At that time, I was especially interested in watching English movies about superhero themes, just as the American superhero movie industry was emerging.At that time, I saw spider-man 3 with my parents in the cinema. It was so good that I wanted to see more movies of the same theme.
        Since then, I have been looking for English superheroes video.It was because of these foreshadowing that I had the idea of studying in the United States when I was in junior high school.Because the education system in China was too rigid at that time, the fate of a student was completely related to the exam, which I think is very unfair.
        Therefore, I began to investigate the American education system and make long-term preparations for my life of studying abroad.<br><br>

        I have many hobbies, such as playing basketball, watching movies, doing music, fitness and playing games.Among them, fitness, playing games and doing music have become my daily life in my spare time.My favorite game is league of legends, because this game tests the teamwork and coordination ability, and also values the individual game level, so I have played this game for 8 years.Sometimes when school is over early, I choose to play basketball. I like watching NBA. My favorite star is lebron James.He is really a legend and sometimes I even imitate him on the pitch.Fitness is a good habit I have cultivated since high school. At that time, because I was very fat, I often went to the playground of our school to run at night after school, which made me obsessed with sports.Since then, I have formed the habit of going to the gym every day. Later, I gradually came into contact with professional fitness, and now I train myself systematically.<br><br>

        My major is business administration, and I love and love what I'm learning.I have loved money since I was very young, and I still love money.Originally, as an international student, my parents wanted me to study a major that is very easy to find a job, such as Computer Science.But I know in my heart that I don't like learning computer programming, because I don't want to work with a computer every day when I grow up.I am a talkative person, so I like to communicate with customers and chat with friends.I also like to make money through my knowledge management, which makes me have a strong interest in the major of business administration.In the process of learning, I have been urging myself to study hard and not careless.Although Computer Science is a very good subject, I finally chose business administration as my major.
